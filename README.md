# Autotune2
Creating an app to recreate the analysis I made in Jupyter Notebook and display real time analysis of insulin demands in different circumstances like exercise.

The app calculates the RMSE and ME for a given set of therapy settings and days.

Note: The calculation takes time. I have not added a loading screen, so the user should just wait until the calculation is made.
